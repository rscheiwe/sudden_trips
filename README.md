# SuddenTrips

SuddenTrips is a single-page app that allows users to plan trips and add trip-based destinations from in-place Google Map API searches. Then, users may share their trip(s) with another user, alter their trip(s), or create new trips.

A demo may be found [here](http://richardscheiwe.com/demos).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Due to cors limitations, the [ThreeJS](http://threejs.org) visualizations do not work on Chrome, so it is best to test devs in Firefox and alter the requirements for images.

## Built With

* [Google Maps](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/maps/) - Searchable and Customizable Maps
* [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) - WebGL/CSS3D Renderer

## Authors

* **Richard Scheiwe** - [Personal](http://richardscheiwe.com)
